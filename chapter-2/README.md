# Welcome
Chapter 2 of this course is focused on the user-facing backend. Specifically with a focus on basic aggregation, updates, deletes, and joins.

## Ticket: Paging
Modify `getMovies` in `mflix-js/src/dao/moviesDAO.js` so that `mflix-js/test/paging.test.js` passes. Verify by running:
```
$ npm test -t paging
```
